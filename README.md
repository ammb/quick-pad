# quick-pad: a dead simple collaborative notepad

hosted at https://quick-pad.herokuapp.com/

This code is absolute garbage and should be cleaned up but:
1: It kind of works anyways
2: Load perf is pretty dang good. (because it's dead simple)

There's still a fair amount to do:
- [ ] Actually use a db
- [ ] Cursor-aware merging
- [ ] Merging at all, actually
- [ ] Use the same request for persistent updates and websockets
- [ ] Actually use a db
- [ ] Impose (large) limits on the size of the notes and the number you can make
- [ ] Actually use a db
- [ ] Actually use a db
- [ ] Make notes expire
