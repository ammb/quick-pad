This code is absolute garbage and should be cleaned up but:
1: It kind of works anyways
2: Load perf is pretty dang good. (because it's dead simple)

##Contributing

Contributions are very very welcome. Please contribute.

1: Be a nice person when you're contributing.

2: But keep in mind small changes are generally easier to write and approve, but don't be afraid to make large scale changes for big features!

3: When contributing ideas for features, keep in mind that this is inherently a very simple app with a very simple interface. I'm not looking for lots of bells and whistles.

4: Heavily consider performance. Profile when you're unsure.
